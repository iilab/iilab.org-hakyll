## What is Open Droplet? 

Open Droplet is an open source, open hardware water measurement sensor that is networked and easy to use.

## Why measure water usage?

Water is one of the [worldâ€™s most stressed resources](https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml). Usage has shot up by more than double the rate of population increase, meaning we are guzzling more water per head than ever before.

Off the back of some of our [preliminary research](https://iilab.org/news/2014-09-10-water-water-everywhere.html), one key component of what we are planning to do with Open Droplet is to provide context to the data collected by individual sensors. This will involve a two-way flow of data between individuals, and utilities and public bodies who are responsible for the water infrastructure. This turns Open Droplet into more than just a water sensor - it's a means of understanding how individual water flows fit within the overall water infrastructure.
